Bridging Maintenance Therapy

Provider Reminders
~ This therapy is for all HR/IR patients who have completed either Blocks 2 and 3 of chemotherapy or both cycles of blinatumomab and due to stem cell source or facility scheduling issues have a lag time greater than 2 weeks after count recovery prior to starting HSCT therapy.  Patients should start bridging therapy when clinically able after meeting count requirements and continue until approximately one week prior to beginning the transplant preparative regimen.
~ Patient should continue PCP prophylaxis, antiemetic, laxative, mouth care, and EMLA as needed at home.  Confirm patient has been provided prescriptions.

Treatment Parameters and Order Schedule		
	~ Begin cycle when peripheral counts recover to ANC greater than or equal to 500 and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000.
~ Maintenance continues based on the dose modifications for low ANC or low platelets (see Section 5.9). Only oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression as outlined in Section 5.9.  Vincristine will be delivered as scheduled, despite myelosuppression.
